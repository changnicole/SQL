# Udemy -- The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022 Assessment 3 (PostgreSQL)
# This assessment will focus on creating databases and table operations

Complete the following task:

Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.

The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, phone, email, and graduation year.
The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, phone, email, and department.

The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:
  1. We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency. 
  2. We must have IDs as the primary key of the tables. 
  3. Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.
  
Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id = 1) who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.

Then insert a teacher named Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) who has a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321.

CREATE TABLE students(
  student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  homeroom_number INTEGER,
  phone_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  grad_year INTEGER);
  
CREATE TABLE teachers(
  teachers_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  homeroom_number INTEGER,
  phone_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE,
  department VARCHAR(50));
  
INSERT INTO students(first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, phone_number, grad_year)
VALUES ('Mark', 'Watney', 5, '7775551234', 2035);

INSERT INTO teachers(first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, phone_number, email, department)
VALUES ('Jonas', 'Salk', 5, '7775554321', 'jsalk@school.org', 'Biology');
